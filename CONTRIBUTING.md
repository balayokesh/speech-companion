## Contributing to speech-companion

We welcome contributions to speech-companion! 

Here are the steps to follow:

### Step 1: 
**Create an [new issue](https://github.com/balayokesh/speech-companion/issues/new) or comment on an [existing issue](https://github.com/balayokesh/speech-companion/issues)**. This allows the maintainers to give feedback and guidance before you begin working on something, and helps ensure that the change is consistent with the overall direction of the project.

### Step 2: 
**Only start working on that Pull Request once the issue is assigned to you**. This will help to avoid any confusion and duplicated work.

### Step 3:
**Create a draft pull request** and start working on adding commits. Use the same code style as the rest of the project. This will make it much easier to merge your changes.

Be prepared to make changes based on feedback from the maintainers.

Thanks for contributing to speech-companion!
